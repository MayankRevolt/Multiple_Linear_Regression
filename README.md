## General Information
This project aims to predict the demand for shared bikes using multiple linear regression. The background of the project is based on a bike-sharing company, BoomBikes, looking to understand the factors influencing bike demand in the American market post-Covid-19 lockdown. The dataset includes various features like season, year, month, weather, temperature, and more.

### Business Problem
BoomBikes wants to prepare for increased demand once the lockdown ends and the economy recovers. The goal is to understand which variables significantly predict bike demand, enabling the company to tailor its business strategy accordingly.

### Dataset
The dataset contains information on daily bike demands across the American market, including factors like weather conditions, temperature, and more.

## Conclusions
- The analysis revealed the top features influencing bike demand, including year, season, and working days.
- The multiple linear regression model achieved an R-squared score of 0.8355, indicating good predictive performance.
- Further exploration of the dataset highlighted the impact of weather conditions and seasonality on bike rentals.



## Acknowledgements
- This project was inspired by the need to help BoomBikes understand and predict bike demand.
